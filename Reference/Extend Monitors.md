# 1. Installing the extension
 https://github.com/spin83/multi-monitors-add-on
    
    git clone git://github.com/spin83/multi-monitors-add-on.git
    cd multi-monitors-add-on
    cp -r multi-monitors-add-on@spin83 ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    
# 2. Activating the extension
  The extension is installed, but Gnome hasn’t loaded it yet. Press “Alt + F2” on your keyboard. This will bring up a command dialog. Type r into it, and press the Enter key. This will re-launch the Gnome Shell, effectively restarting it.
 
# 3. Install Tweak Tool
    sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
  Once installed, just search for Tweak Tool in the Gnome Activities area and launch it. After that, just click Extensions on the left-hand side. Scroll down till you see multi-monitors-add-on and tick the slider to activate it.
